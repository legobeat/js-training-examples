# Preparation for training
 
- clone or download the repository https://github.com/naugtur/js-training-examples
- install Node.js with fetch support (preferred latest stable, tested in v20) and npm

The training was designed and tested in `bash` so while there's nothing that we expect to break under Windows, if you're runing Windows, WSL or a linux VM would be preferred.
