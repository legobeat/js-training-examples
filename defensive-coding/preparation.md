# Preparation for training

- make sure you understand where the map function is coming to your newly created Array `[].map` and overall what prototypes are in JavaScript https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes
 
- clone or download the repository https://github.com/naugtur/js-training-examples
- install Node.js with fetch support (preferred latest stable, tested in v20) and npm
- If you prefer debugging JavaScript in the browser:
  - You need a browser with devtools and a modern JS engine. 
    (Chromium based browsers or Firefox have been tested to work with this.)
  - Follow the instructions in the exercise to set up.
- test out running the first attack from the exercise to make sure it works

The second part of the training was designed and tested in `bash` so while there's nothing that we wxpect to break under Windows, if you're runing Windows, WSL or a linux VM would be preferred.
